"""Re-ship a host's proxy trust declaration without a full setup run.

``forwardedHeaders.trustedIPs`` is static configuration: Traefik reads it
once at start-up, so unlike the documents it watches, a change here only
takes effect when the proxy restarts. That makes this a job of its own
rather than a file drop — and it is why the ranges are re-shipped only
when they actually moved, since every push costs the host a proxy
restart and the connections in flight through it.

        it from the hardening playbook, which runs on Ansible and only
        at host creation or a deliberate re-hardening. So the list the
        firewall enforced was whatever it was handed the day the host
