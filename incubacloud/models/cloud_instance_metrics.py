"""Derive ``cloud.instance.running`` from metrics (Fase 4 / A8).

Today ``running`` is written by ``instance_health_executor`` — one SSH job
per instance every few minutes, the telemetry that does not scale past
~100 targets. This is its replacement: the same fact read from cAdvisor,
which the agents already report.

**Why cAdvisor and not Traefik.** ``running`` means *the instance's
``odoo`` container is up*, which is the same thing the SSH probe
measures. "Is anyone using it" is a different fact, already modelled by
``sleeping`` (decided by Sablier from real traffic) and by
``last_activity_at``. If ``running`` were sourced from request traffic, a
healthy but idle instance would read as not-running, and the 14-day
auto-suspend that hangs off that chain would eventually act on legitimate
idleness — a billing consequence, not just a cosmetic one.

**Nothing is retired here.** The SSH telemetry keeps running until this
signal has been verified against real data; flipping the source and
deleting the old one in the same step is how you find out too late that
the new one had a blind spot.

        Two questions, not one. The first is which instances the backend
        reports on at all; the second is how long since each one's
        ``odoo`` container was seen. Only the second decides the flag —
        ``running`` has always meant *that* container, the same thing the
        SSH probe measures, and asking about any container of the stack
        answers a different question. An instance can keep its database
        and backup containers up while its ``odoo`` is stopped, so the
        loose form said "yes" all night and the flag never fell: the
        sleep/wake tracking that hangs off it never fired, and the panel
        showed a stopped instance as running.

        A third question covers the stack stopped whole. Its containers
        leave the backend within a scrape, so it drops out of the first
        answer altogether, and left alone its flag stayed True until the
        SSH probe took it back up to twenty minutes later. An instance
        the backend used to report on and now reports nothing of, on a
        host that still reports containers, has its whole stack stopped
        and is written as not running. Never one the backend never
        reported on, and never when the host itself has gone quiet.

        Fail-safe, three times over:

        * a backend that cannot be reached updates nothing — silence is
          not evidence that instances stopped;
        * an instance the backend has never reported on is left untouched
          rather than marked stopped, so a host whose agents are not
          installed yet keeps whatever the SSH telemetry says; and
        * a fleet that reports containers but not one ``odoo`` among them
          is a broken query or a missing label far more plausibly than
          every instance stopping at once, so that too changes nothing.
