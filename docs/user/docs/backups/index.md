# Backups

Backups go to **your own S3 bucket** — AWS, MinIO, Backblaze B2, Wasabi, or any
S3-compatible service. You hold the keys. We run the schedule and the encryption.

## How it works

1. You register a **backup backend** (your S3 endpoint + credentials + a passphrase).
2. You attach the backend to a project (or set it as the global default).
3. The platform runs a nightly backup on every production instance and
   uploads the encrypted bundle to your bucket.
4. Manual backups are available any time from the instance detail.

The backup format is the standard Odoo dump (`dump.sql + filestore/`) wrapped
in an encrypted archive.

## Retention by plan

!!! info "IncubaCloud SaaS"
    Plan-based retention applies to the hosted service. Self-hosted deployments
    configure retention per backend.

| Plan | Automatic backup retention |
| --- | --- |
| Free | None (manual backups only) |
| Starter | 7 days |
| Professional | 14 days |
| Business | 30 days |

Manual backups never expire. They count against your bucket storage,
not against the retention window.

## Managed Backup Storage

!!! info "IncubaCloud SaaS — paid add-on"

If you'd rather not bring your own bucket, the platform can provision one for
you: a dedicated bucket with its own scoped credentials, handed to you as a
ready-to-use backup backend. Three tiers:

| Tier | Included storage | Monthly | Overage |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Starter | 20 GB | 2.99 € | 0.05 €/GB |
| Standard | 100 GB | 8.99 € | 0.04 €/GB |
| Pro | 500 GB | 29.99 € | 0.03 €/GB |

Usage is measured periodically; storage beyond the included amount is billed as
overage on your subscription invoice. If you cancel the add-on, backups are kept
for a 30-day retention window before the bucket is purged. Downgrading to a
smaller tier gives you a grace period to get usage under the new limit.

## Encryption

Every backup is encrypted with the **passphrase** you set on the backend before
it leaves the host. We don't store the passphrase in clear and we can't recover it.
Treat it like a master key — store a copy in your password manager.

## What lives where

- **Bucket** — your S3, encrypted bundles. We never see the raw data.
- **IncubaCloud database** — backend metadata (endpoint, region, bucket name).
  Credentials are encrypted at rest with our own platform key.

## Common tasks

- Set up your first backup backend (use the [marketing site quickstart](https://www.incubacloud.io/docs/backups))
- [Restore a backup](restore.md)
- Receive an email when a backup completes (Backend detail → Notifications)
- Override the project-level backend on a single instance
  (Instance detail → Settings → Backup backend)
